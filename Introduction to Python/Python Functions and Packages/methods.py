# Methods: Functions that belong to objects
# Everything = object
# Object have methods associated, depending on type
# Methods: call functions on objects

# Strings come with a bunch of methods. 
# Follow the instructions closely to discover some of them. 

# help(str);

# string to experiment with: place
place = "poolhouse"

# Use upper() on place: place_up
place_up = place.upper()

# Print out place and place_up
print(place)
print(place_up)
# Print out the number of o's in place
print(place.count("o"))

# Strings are not the only Python types that have methods associated with them.
# Lists, floats, integers and booleans are also types that come packaged with a bunch of useful methods.

# index(), to get the index of the first element of a list that matches its input and
# count(), to get the number of times an element appears in a list. 

# Create list areas
areas = [11.25, 18.0, 20.0, 10.75, 9.50]

# Print out the index of the element 20.0
print(areas.index(20.0))

# Print out how often 9.50 appears in areas
print(areas.count(9.50))


# append(), that adds an element to the list it is called on,
# remove(), that removes the first element of a list that matches the input, and
# reverse(), that reverses the order of the elements in the list it is called on.

# Use append twice to add poolhouse and garage size
areas.append(24.5)
areas.append(15.45)

# Print out areas
print(areas)

# Reverse the orders of the elements in areas
areas.reverse()

# Print out areas
print(areas)
