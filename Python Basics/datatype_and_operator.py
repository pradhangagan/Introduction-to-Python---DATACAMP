# To find out the type of a value or a variable that refers to that value, you can use the type() function
# When you sum two strings, for example, you'll get different behavior than when you sum two integers or two booleans.
# Using the + operator to paste together two strings can be very useful in building custom messages.

monthly_savings = 10
num_months = 12
intro = "Hello! How are you?"

# Calculate year_savings using monthly_savings and num_months
year_savings = monthly_savings * num_months;

# Print the type of year_savings
print(year_savings);
print(type(year_savings));

# Assign sum of intro and intro to doubleintro
doubleintro = intro + intro;

# Print out doubleintro
print(doubleintro);
